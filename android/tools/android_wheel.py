# Vendored from the `python-android-apk` skill
# (skills/synced/python-android-apk/scripts/android_wheel.py).
#
# It lives here because CI checks out this repository and nothing else:
# the skill is installed in a developer's home directory, so a workflow
# cannot reach it.  Upstream changes should be ported manually.
#
# Two local changes, both load-bearing for this project:
#
#  1. `-X annotation_typing=False` on the cython invocation.  Cython
#     otherwise treats Python annotations as enforced C types, and this
#     tree annotates descriptively while passing numpy scalars around:
#     `max_db: float | None` then rejects the np.float64 that
#     metrics/ccdf.py assigns to it ("Expected float, got numpy.float64").
#     Two tests caught it; the untested paths are the reason the fix is
#     "stop enforcing annotations" rather than "edit the analysis layer
#     until the compiler is happy".
#  2. Package ``__init__.py`` files are never compiled.  They are
#     re-export shims here — no algorithms, so compiling them buys no
#     protection — while an extension module acting as a package
#     initializer is the one construct an import system treats specially.
#     Kept for that reason alone.
#
#     Correction (2026-08-25): this change was first made to explain a
#     device-side "does not define module export function (PyInit_cal)",
#     and that diagnosis was wrong — see change 3, which is the actual
#     cause.  The same failure came back one level down as PyInit_sync.
#  3. ``PyMODINIT_FUNC`` is redefined on the compiler command line so the
#     module init function is exported.  Upstream compiles with
#     ``-fvisibility=hidden``, which is safe only where the target's
#     headers attach ``visibility("default")`` to that macro themselves.
#     CPython does so from 3.9 (via ``Py_EXPORTED_SYMBOL``); **3.8, which
#     is what Chaquopy ships for Android, does not** — its pyport.h falls
#     through to a bare ``PyObject*``.  So the host build (3.11) exported
#     PyInit_<mod> and the cross build silently did not, and the device
#     answered "dynamic module does not define module export function".
#     A host-built wheel cannot reproduce it; the two headers differ.
#  4. Nothing else.  Keep it that way — the diff against upstream should
#     stay readable.
#
# Cython 3.3.0 must NOT be used: it crashes on imaginary literals
# (ImagNode -> AttributeError), and this is a complex-baseband tree where
# `1j` is everywhere.  3.0.11 and 3.1.6 are verified good.

"""Build a Chaquopy-installable wheel with part of a Python package compiled to
native code.

Why this exists
---------------
An APK is a zip, Chaquopy's payload inside it is a zip, and ``.pyc`` gives back
function names, line numbers and whole docstrings to anyone who runs
``strings``.  Cythonising the modules you care about and shipping ``.so``
replaces that with machine code.

Be clear about what it does not buy before you spend a day on it: anything you
leave uncompiled still ships as bytecode, WebView assets stay plain text, and
literal constants survive compilation in the constant pool where a short script
finds them exactly.  This raises the cost of reading your *algorithms*.  It is
not a licence check and it is not obfuscation of your data.

How it works
------------
Every input is public and standard, which is why this is a few hundred lines
rather than a fork of Chaquopy:

* Android CPython -- headers and ``libpythonX.Y.so`` -- is published on **Maven
  Central** as ``com.chaquo.python:target``, not behind chaquo.com.  So the
  wheel build works even where the Gradle side's package index does not.
* The compiler is the plain NDK clang wrapper.  Chaquopy's own
  ``target/android-env.sh`` does nothing more exotic.
* The wheel tag format comes from Chaquopy's ``server/pypi/build-wheel.py``:
  ``cp310-cp310-android_21_arm64_v8a``.
* Cythonised pure-Python modules need **only** ``Python.h``.  Third-party
  binary dependencies (numpy, scipy, …) stay as Chaquopy's own prebuilt
  wheels; nothing here rebuilds them.

One version caveat: on CPython 3.10 the generated C stays on the public API,
because Cython's ``internal/pycore_frame.h`` include sits behind
``PY_VERSION_HEX >= 0x030b00a6``.  On 3.11+ that include is live, so the
headers must be the exact target build rather than merely the right minor
version.

Usage
-----
    # cross-compile for a device, from your project root
    python android_wheel.py --package mylib --compile core,solvers \
        --abi arm64-v8a --ndk "$ANDROID_NDK_HOME"

    # same logic, this machine's compiler, no NDK -- how to test changes here
    python android_wheel.py --package mylib --compile core,solvers --host

``--package`` is auto-detected when the project has exactly one importable
package.  ``--compile`` is deliberately **not** optional and has no "everything"
default: the set you compile is a claim that your test suite still passes with
those ``.py`` files deleted, and a default would make that claim for you.  Pass
``--compile all`` if you really mean the whole tree, then go prove it.
