"""Report what Python an APK actually ships, and optionally gate on it.

Chaquopy packs the Python tree into ``.imy`` archives inside the APK, so
``unzip -l`` on the APK shows you nothing useful.  This walks into them.

Two questions it answers, both of which are otherwise guesswork:

*What is in here?*  Which top-level packages ship, and for each one how many
modules are source (``.py``/``.pyc``) versus native (``.so``).  Useful on an
APK someone hands you, and the fastest honest answer to "is my source
readable in this thing".

*Is this the build I think it is?*  If you produce both an interpreted and a
compiled APK from one workspace, the dangerous failure is the second build
reusing the first's pip output -- the artifacts differ in name only, and no
line of the build log says so.  ``--native`` and ``--pure`` turn the intent
into an assertion that fails the job.

    # report
    python inspect_apk.py app-debug.apk

    # gate: these subpackages must be compiled, these must not be
    python inspect_apk.py compiled.apk --package mylib --native core,solvers
    python inspect_apk.py interpreted.apk --package mylib --pure core,solvers

Exit status is 0 when every requested assertion holds (and, with no
assertions, when every APK contained a readable Python payload).
