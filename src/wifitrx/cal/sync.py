"""Time alignment of PA input/output captures.

Measured or EDA-exported data often has an unknown bulk delay (and complex
gain) between the stimulus and the capture. Behavioral-model fitting
assumes sample-aligned x/y, so run :func:`align_delay` first. (OpenDPD
datasets ship pre-aligned; Cadence envelope exports and lab captures
usually do not.)
