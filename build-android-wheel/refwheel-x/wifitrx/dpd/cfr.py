"""Crest Factor Reduction by iterative clipping and filtering (ICF).

DPD can only linearize up to the PA's maximum output: OFDM peaks (PAPR
~10-12 dB) that drive the PA past its AM-AM turnover are unrecoverable
and make ILA diverge. Industrial transmit chains therefore run CFR
before DPD, trading a bounded amount of in-band EVM for several dB of
PAPR so that the whole envelope stays inside the PA's invertible region.

Iterative clipping and filtering: hard-clip the envelope at the target
level, then brick-wall filter to the signal bandwidth to remove the
clipping splatter. Filtering partially regrows the peaks, so the pair of
steps is iterated.
