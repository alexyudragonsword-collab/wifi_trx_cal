"""Virtual "device under test" PA for synthetic data generation.

A Wiener-Hammerstein structure (FIR -> Saleh nonlinearity -> FIR) with
fixed coefficients. It plays the role of the transistor-level PA
(Cadence Spectre envelope simulation) until real EDA data is plugged in:
downstream modeling/DPD code treats it as a black box x -> y.

The structure is intentionally NOT in the GMP model class, so fitted GMP
models approximate it (realistic residual error) rather than match exactly.

Input is assumed to be normalized to unit average power; ``drive`` sets
the operating point (larger = closer to saturation). Small-signal gain is
normalized to ~1 so absolute gain drops out of modeling and metrics.

Note on invertibility: DPD can only linearize up to the PA's maximum
output. With unit-power OFDM (PAPR ~10-11 dB) the peak envelope is
~3.3-3.8, and the Saleh AM-AM turns over at r = 1/sqrt(beta_a). Keep
``drive`` <= ~0.15 so that peaks stay in the invertible region; around
0.22 and above the ILA DPD diverges at the peaks (a realistic failure
mode — real systems add crest factor reduction or more back-off).
