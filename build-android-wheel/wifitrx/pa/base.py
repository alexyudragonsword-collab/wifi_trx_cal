"""Common interface for PA behavioral models.

Every model maps a complex baseband input sequence to a complex output
sequence via ``__call__``. Trainable models additionally implement
``fit(x, y)``. Neural models added in later phases should follow the same
interface so they can be swapped against the GMP baseline.
