"""Fixed-point (bit-true) evaluation of linear-in-parameters models.

A model like ``y = Phi @ w`` (MP / GMP / DDR-Volterra) is evaluated on
hardware as: form the basis columns Phi (from a quantized input), quantize
each column and the coefficients to a chosen bit width, then accumulate the
products in a wide accumulator. This module reproduces that datapath in
numpy so the quantization loss can be measured before committing to RTL.

Quantizer: symmetric signed, power-of-two step size (as in OpenDPD's
``round_scale2pow2`` and typical DPD ASICs) so scaling is a bit shift.
Complex values share one format across I and Q (as in real IQ datapaths).

This is a behavioral bit-true model of the arithmetic, not a full RTL
timing/resource model; the accumulator is treated as full precision
(wide enough not to overflow), which matches well-designed DPD hardware.
